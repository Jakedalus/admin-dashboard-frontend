# Admin Dashboard Frontend

Download or clone the code. cd into the directory, `/frontend`.

There, run

`npm install`

Once that is finished, you can start up the app by running

`npm start`

## To run the E2E tests

To run the Cypress integration tests, the frontend and backend must both be running (see the Backend README for more details on 
running the backend). Once both have started, run

`npm run cypress:open`

Cypress will then open. Click the button that says "Run 1 integration spec" to start the tests in a browser.
